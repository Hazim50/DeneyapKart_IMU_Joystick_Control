I took this code from DeneyapKart. In "Advanced Robotic" course, i explained this code to my students. 

The purpose of this code is to control two servo motors, an LSM6DSM accelerometer, and a button using an ESP32 microcontroller. 
The application adjusts the position of the servo motors based on joystick and button inputs, while also utilizing data from the accelerometer to move the motors to specific angles. 
Additionally, three LEDs are used to indicate the system's status.
